# Bank Transaction App

This is a demo bank transaction app that allows users to perform basic banking transactions such as checking their account balance, transferring funds to another account, requesting loan and viewing transaction history.

## Using the App

The app has three main sections:

### Account Balance

The account balance section displays the current balance of the user's account. To access this section, click on the "Account Balance" button on the main menu.

### Transfer Funds

The transfer funds section allows users to transfer funds to another account. To access this section, click on the "Transfer Funds" button on the main menu. You will need to enter the recipient's account number and the amount you wish to transfer.

### Transaction History

The transaction history section displays a list of all transactions made on the user's account. To access this section, click on the "Transaction History" button on the main menu.
### Take Loan 

The loan section displays aallows users to request for funds made on the user's account. To access this section, click on the "Loan section" button on the main menu.

## Security

The app uses demo-standard encryption and security measures to protect user data. However, this is just a demo app and should not be used for real banking transactions.

## Future Improvements

There are several improvements that could be made to the app, including:

- Adding authentication to ensure that only authorized users can access the app.
- Allowing users to view and manage multiple accounts.
- Adding more transaction types, such as bill payments and deposits.
- Improving the user interface to make the app more user-friendly.
